				"date": "June 16",
				"post": "<p>7pm: Attention all students, there have been reports of several manhole fires around the town in seemingly random areas, methane leaks are suspected. Isolated power outages around campus, uncertain of time for restoration of power.</p><p>8:30 pm: Power has been restored to a limited number of campus buildings, however the main administration building remains without electricity or air condition. There have been some scheduling changes to the parents' weekend event scheduled for this afternoon; more news to follow.</p><p>9 pm: As a general safety precaution, do not light candles in buildings during the power outage. As previously mentioned, there may be trace amounts of methane and candles would prove handy ignition sources.</p><p>Researchers: please be cautious of the danger posed by power surges during the outage. Please take appropriate measures to protect sensitive (and likely expensive) equipment by unplugging them from the wall.</p>"
